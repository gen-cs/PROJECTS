Quantitative Analysis of Risk and Return for a Multi-Asset Financial Portfolio Using Python
• Built a three-stock portfolio consisting of Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and Bank of America;
calculated and compared multiple return types including daily simple returns, log returns, and
cumulative returns to analyze stock behavior and growth over time.
• Performed a full risk and performance assessment using advanced financial metrics such as
Alpha, Beta, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Treynor Ratio, Standard Deviation, Maximum
Drawdown, Value at Risk (VaR), and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), providing a robust view
of the portfolio’s risk-adjusted returns and tail risk exposure.
